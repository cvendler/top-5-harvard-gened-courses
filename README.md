# Top 5 Harvard General Education Courses by Undergraduate Enrollment

[Link to Rpub](http://rpubs.com/cvendler/top-5-Harvard-gened-courses)

Here, I use Harvard Registrar data regarding class enrollment to show the relative enrollment sizes of the largest General Education classes by fall and spring semester from the 2016-17 through 2018-19 academic years. The graphics show that there are more people enrolled in these larger gen-eds in the fall than in the spring and that in both seasons, the year-to-year major classes do exhibit some similarities but do experience some churn.
